YouTube Skeleton iOS!
===================

This is a for-fun project to dive deeper into auto-layout programmatically and utilizing the power and flexibility of UICollectionViews. 
UICollectionViews have easily become one of my favorite classes in UIKit! 
I have also changed my views on storyboard from this project. Doing everything programmatically has a better feel to it, and seems to be more flexible when embedding custom views and making it pixel perfect.
